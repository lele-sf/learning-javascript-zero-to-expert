# Data Structures, Modern Operators and Strings

This section covers key concepts related to data structures, modern JavaScript operators, and string manipulation. Topics include:

1. **Destructuring Arrays**: Efficient extraction and assignment of values from arrays.

2. **Destructuring Objects**: Object destructuring for improved code readability.

3. **The Spread Operator ( ... )**: Utilization of the spread operator for expanding arrays and passing multiple values into functions.

4. **Rest Pattern and Parameters**: Usage of the rest pattern and parameters for collecting multiple elements and condensing multiple parameters into a single array.
    - [MDN: Rest parameters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/rest_parameters)

5. **Short Circuiting (&& and ||)**: Exploration of short-circuiting using logical AND (`&&`) and OR (`||`) operators.

6. **The Nullish Coalescing Operator ( ?? )**: Usage of the nullish coalescing operator (`??`) to handle null and undefined values.

7. **Looping Arrays: The for-of Loop**: Iteration through arrays using the modern for-of loop.

8. **Enhanced Object Literals**: Exploration of enhanced object literal syntax for expressive object creation.

9. **Optional Chaining ( .? )**: Usage of optional chaining to simplify object property access.

10. **Looping Objects: Object Keys, Values, and Entries**: Techniques for looping through object keys, values, and entries.

11. **Sets**: Insight into sets, a built-in data structure in JavaScript for storing unique values.

12. **Maps: Fundamentals**: Introduction to maps, a built-in data structure in JavaScript for storing key-value pairs.

13. **Maps: Iteration**: Iteration through maps using the `forEach()`, `keys()`, `values()`, and `entries()` methods.

14. **Summary: Which Data Structure to Use?**: Guidance on selecting the appropriate data structure for different scenarios.

15. **Working With Strings**: Deep dive into essential string manipulation techniques and operations.

# JavaScript Fundamentals - Part 1

This section of the course covers the following key topics:

1. **Introduction to JavaScript**: An overview of the JavaScript programming language and its role in web development.

2. **Linking a JS File**: How to connect a JavaScript file to an HTML document for execution.    

3. **Values and Variables**: Understanding variable declaration and assignment of values.

4. **Data Types**: An exploration of JavaScript's data types, including numbers, strings, etc.

5. **let, const, and var**: Differentiating between variable declaration using `let`, `const`, and `var`.

6. **Basic Operators**: Introduction to arithmetic and comparison operators in JavaScript.

7. **Operator Precedence**: How JavaScript determines the order of operations in expressions.

8. **String and Template Literals**: Working with strings and template literals for dynamic content.
    
9. **Taking Decisions: if / else Statements**: Conditional statements using `if` and `else`.

10. **Type Conversion and Coercion**: Handling type conversion and coercion in JavaScript.

11. **Truthy and Falsy Values**: Understanding truthy and falsy values in conditional statements.

12. **Equality Operators: == vs. ===**: Differences between `==` and `===` for equality comparisons.

    The `==` operator performs a loose equality comparison that performs type coercion if necessary to make the comparison possible.
    The `===` operator, on the other hand, performs a strict equality comparison that does not perform type coercion and requires the operands to have the same type (as well as the same value).

13. **Boolean Logic**: Basic concepts of boolean logic and logical operators.

14. **Logical Operators**: Using logical operators `&&`, `||`, and `!`.

15. **The switch Statement**: Utilizing the `switch` statement for multiple cases.

16. **Statements and Expressions**: Differentiating between statements and expressions in JavaScript.

17. **The Conditional (Ternary) Operator**: Introduction to the ternary operator for concise conditionals.

18. **JavaScript Releases: ES5, ES6+ and ESNext**: Overview of JavaScript releases including ES5, ES6+, and ESNext.

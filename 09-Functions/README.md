# A Closer Look at Functions

This section delves deeper into the intricacies of JavaScript functions, covering a range of advanced topics. The key subjects explored in this section include:

1. **Default Parameters**: Understanding the concept of default parameters and how to use them in functions.

2. **How Passing Arguments Works: Value vs. Reference**: An exploration of how arguments are passed to functions and how this differs between primitives and objects.

5. **Functions Returning Functions**: Exploring functions that return other functions.

6. **The call and apply Methods**: An in-depth look at the `call` and `apply` methods and how they can be used to manipulate the `this` value in functions.
